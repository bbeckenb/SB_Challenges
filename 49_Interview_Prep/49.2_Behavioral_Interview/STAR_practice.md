1. Why do you want to be a software engineer?
I've always been a builder, when I was young I was obsessed with Legos. This translated into my desire to learn Electrical Engineering. 

Throughout my life I have learned things about myself, when I was young I gravitated toward Legos and knew I loved to build and create. In college I chose Electrical Engineering because I wanted to challenge myself and solve complex problems, when I went into sales I learned I wanted my problem solving to be technical and not administrative.

I am an avid continuous learner - as I went through Data Science stuff, I learned I want my deliverable to be something I built. Being able to build something from anywhere in the world and have an endless amount to learn in this domain (among others) is extremely appealing for both career and lifestyle.

As we have seen and know from our everyday lives, software is everywhere and has extremely broad reach. As someone who wants to help improve the lives of as many people as I can, being part of building tools and platforms is an efficient way to help a lot of people.
