1. Why do you want to be a software engineer?
I want three things in my career
    1. To help people
    2. To be challenged
    3. To build things

    Software engineering beautifully checks these boxes in that it is embedded in almost every aspect of our lives today, in most cases improving it, it is a problem solver's dream with endless learning opportunity, and your deliverable is a tangible thing that you can see the growth of. 

2. Why do you want to work at this company?
As someone going through a job search myself, I resonate with your mission to humanize the experience. As the fastest growing company in HR tech and among the top 100 overall, who would not want to be an impact player on that team and learn from people who clearly understand who to design and execute on a vision.


3. Tell me about a time you had to handle a conflict with your colleagues.
Luckily, I have been part of some very professional organizations, so these types of interactions have been few and far between in my experience. There was a situation where in my sales engineering role where I had been coordinating a long-term parts reservation and plan with a defense contractor for the Navy. The deal had around a $250k price tag and looked certain to close within the next couple of months. I was speaking with a colleague of mine and fellow sales engineer about the deal, he stated a sister site was also in his territory. A key detail is that we had both been in the role for about 8 months at that point. I guess he did some research on the history of how my site and his worked together, his site was the headquarters and my site was the production facility. When this program had originally started (a few years prior to either of us being in our roles), the sales engineer before him had done the leg work for the original deal and therefore the split for the order was 85% to his site and 15% to mine. My colleague blind sided me and put together a meeting between himself, myself, and our sales managers. Because the original sale was reflected into his expected quota, he wanted the same 85-15 split. This was fair to an extent EXCEPT that I had invested a good amount of time and resources over my tenure into moving this deal forward, much more than what was reflected in that split.

The outcome of that meeting was not what I would have hoped. I was frustrated that I did not feel my efforts were being acknowledged. I went and asked if I could speak to my colleague one-on-one, which he agreed to. I explained I understood that his quota was on the line and I would want some help if I was in a similar situation. BUT, I had been taking on the full responsibility for months and that him, effectively, swooping in toward the end of the deal to cash in on my efforts and him being ok with the status-quo of that was not extremely reasonable, and asked if he would not feel similarly if he were in my position. I got him to agree to have a second meeting with our managers. The outcome of that discussion was that I would receive 30% - 70% of that particular deal and upon closing of the deal, the sister site I was working with would be moved into his book of accounts where he would be the sole point of contact.
