OOP has been a standard convention for over 20 years and is organized around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. It is ever-present and it is very unlikely a candidate would not have run into it at some point.

Here are ten examples of terms they should be able to define:

class, object (and the difference between the two)
method (as opposed to, say, a C function)
virtual method, pure virtual method
class/static method
static/class initializer
constructor
destructor/finalizer
superclass or base class
subclass or derived class
