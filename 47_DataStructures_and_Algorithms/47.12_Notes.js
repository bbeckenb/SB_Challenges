/**
 * Heaps
    * Priority Queues - Specialized tree, rule (heap priority)
    * Max Heap, children of parent must be less than parent
    * 
 * Tries - 'Retrieval'
    * "Prefix Trees"
    * For Autocomplete Structure
    * Marker node denotes when a word has been spelt
 * Bloom Filter
    * Like a Set - answers "Is a particular item in a collection?"
    * Use them when you want to efficiently make sure an item is NOT there
    * Can have 'false positives'
 * MUST KNOWS
    * When to use arrays, objects, LLs, trees, graphs
    * Big O notation & runtime of common operations
    * Identifying recursion
    * Traversal in LLs, trees, graphs via DFS and BFS
    * Searching and traversing of bin trees
    * What does data look like, what does insertion look like?
    * Can study this stuff if you want!
