 * Event Handlers & State
 * 
 * onclick needs to be camelcased in react 'onClick'
 * https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html - other event options
 * wraps event in own object
 * currentTarget (DOM Elements, seen before in vanilla JS)
 * Can pass in paramater to any event callback and it contains a bunch of data about our event
 * 
 * State
    * data specific to a component
    * can change!
    * ex: toggling visibility, colors, styles, themes
    * State hook, add state to a functional component
 * State vs Props
    * if data needs to change it needs to be in state somewhere
    * want to minimize state
