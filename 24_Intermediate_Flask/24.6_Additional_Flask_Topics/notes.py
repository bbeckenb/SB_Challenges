Flask is more customizable, Django is more opinionated and rigid

Did not cover in Flask:
- url_for: you can define a route and then call url_for(view_func_name)
-Blueprints: you can build 'applications' in Flask
    -re-use/ modularity, extends view-functions

Did not cover in Jinja:
- Jinja filters
-Macros: wrap up python into re-usable
-Super

WTForm & SQLA
-WTForms-Alchemy: creating forms off of models

Flask-Login
-helps w/ login/ logout/ bcrypt stuff

Flask-Mail
-configuring e-mail stuff

Flask-Admin
-see interface to view data based off a model
-Full CRUD admin views for SQLAlchemy tables

Flask-Restless
-creates a full CRUD Restful API off your app

Will we use Flask (maybe), it's popular and used by real companies, large and small.
-Good for personal projects, code challenges

Flask vs Node-Express:
-Pretty similar
-Both work at same 'level of concepts', and share lots of ideas
-You can use Jinja to make templates w/ Express!

Flask v Django:
-out of the box, Django does more, it is more opinionated
-can build apps better w/ Django
