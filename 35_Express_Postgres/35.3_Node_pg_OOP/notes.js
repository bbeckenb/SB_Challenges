/**
 * OOP - to help us organizing
 * Encapsulation - group functionality into logical pieces
 * Polymorphism - ability to implement similar functionality in different classes
 * Could have other kinds of animals with the same API, but they behave slightly differently
 * If you define the class method as 'static' you can just call the class to invoke the method, you don't need to make an instance 
 * 
 * Creating mini-ORM
