/**
 * Whiteboarding
 * 1. Repeat back the prompt
 * 2. Ask clarifying questions
    * 'will these all be integers?'
    * 'Do I just skip over odd numbers?'
    * 'By avg do you mean the mean?'
    * 'Do I print the result or return it?'
    * Why do you do this?
        * to buy more time
        * to understand the challenge details
        * demonstrate you care about the details
        * so you wirte bug-free code 
 * 3. Write down the requirements
    * make short bulleted list of req's on white board
        * so you can't forget any details
        * gives you a moment to think with less pressure
    * For example:
        * function given integers
        * just skip odd numbers
        * get mean or even numbers
        * return mean  
 * 4. Stop & think
    * don't just start writing code
    * think about your strategy    
 * 5. Pseudo-Code
    * Can keep you from getting lost in the weeds
 * 
 * Code:
    * Start at the top-left of the board
        * Need space to fit the codes
    * Write neatly and evenly
        * In python, you may find it helpful to show indentation with lines  
 *
 * Test your code BE THE COMPUTER 
    * keep track of vars (use a table)
 *
 * Hints:
    * It is fine to ask for a hint
 *
 * Good variable names are important
    * Don't write down 'x'
    * something short but descriptive
 *
 * Test, Don't hand-wave      
    * Some parts are hairy and you might feel shaky
    * it's easy to try to hand-wave past them
        * Resist that temptation
            * the pars you're less sure of need the slowest testing
            * BE THE COMPUTER   
 *
 * It's not an API quiz
    * try to remember the very most common operations
    * e.g. to add to an array, it's .push()
    * 
 * whiteboarding is not an API pop quiz
    * it is ok to ask what a method is called
    * it's ok to use a best guess name (e.g. mySet.addItem())   
 *
 * Take your time!
    * Interviewers will not be checking watches
    * They want to see you think deeply
    * Don;t let nerves speed up your speech
    * DON'T PANIC  
 *
 * You have useful new skills
    * they are hungry for people they can hire - they want you to succeed!
    * Think of them as a 'pair programmer' they are there to collaborate with 
 * 
 * Practice binary search w/ no computer 
 * Partial credit
    * not p/f
    * Do what you can, even if it's only pseudocode
    * even if it's a simpler case
    * even if it's just 1 part of the problem 
    * They want to see how you think and handle pressure
    * sometimes questions are really hard
    * They typically don't want you to solve it with a built-in function
 * Don't go radio silent!
    * Don't go silent for too long - let them know where you are!
    * Use the white board for scratch space
        * helps keep you organized
        * helps them see where you are!
