//JS OO under the hood
//'new' create new instance of class from pattern
    // creates a blank, plain JS obj
    //Links (sets constructor of) this object to another object
    //Passes the newly created object from step 1 as the 'this' context
    //returns 'this' if the function doesn't return its own obj
//every function is an obj

function bark() {
    return 'woof woof!';
}

//every function object has a property called 'prototype'
//property is an object itself, in obj, there is a special property called constructor
//constructor is going to point to the same function
//can see 'Link' by typing in 'Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)'
//adding a method
//define functions on the object prototype to minimize redefinition of the function for each instance


//Purpose of prototype obj
/**
 * JS uses this object to find methods and properties on everything in JS
 * If a property cannot be found, JS works it's way up the prototype chain finding the prototype of every object
 * looks on local instance prototype then looks on the parent object prototype, etc. etc.
 * Look into inheritance
 * function Vehicle(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

Vehicle.prototype.honk = function() {
  return 'Beep!';
};

function Car(make, model, year) {
  Vehicle.call(this, make, model, year); // similar to "super(make, model, year)"
}

Car.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);
Car.prototype.constructor = Car;
Notes on ES5 OOP
ES2015 does all of this under the hood
Make sure youâ€™re able to explain what a prototype is
Be able to define the prototype chain, how inheritance can be implemented
