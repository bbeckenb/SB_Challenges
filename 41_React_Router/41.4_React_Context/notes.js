 * Motivation:
    * Prop drilling passing 'props' down each level to children/ grandchildren, etc.
 * Create a context 'const contextName = React.createContext();'  
    * Creates object
    * Need to use provider, wrap parent component you don't want to have to tunnel through children of
    * we can pass multiple things (pieces of state, functions, etc.)
